~ CHEESERAT ~
- This game is about a mouse picking up pieces of cheese in the kitchen.
- Game genre: Casual.
- Image: I used some pictures I found in google image search.
- Source of inspiration: I once caught a mouse stealing cheese from my kitchen. Even though I cleaned it up and took measures to prevent it from returning to my small kitchen to scavenge for food, I still found it interesting to observe the actions of other creatures. Along with the image of the rat chef Remy in the movie Ratatouille I watched as a child, I created this small game during my programming class at school. Although it has many imperfections, I quite like this little game. In the future, if I have time I will develop this game further.

Hope you guys enjoy it!
